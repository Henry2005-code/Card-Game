HENRY'S SWEGG USER MANUAL
The game starts by drawing 5 random cards from a deck of 54 cards for both the user and the computer. 

Deck Of Cards contains 54 Cards
10 Stars(Numbered 1 - 10) - ★

10  Circles(Numbered 1 - 10) - ◍

10 Triangles(Numbered 1 - 10) - ▲


10 Crosses(Numbered 1 - 10) - ✚

4 SWEGG’s(Numbered 1 - 4) - SW

Then another card is drawn from both the deck to serve as the base card. 
If the player has a card similar to the base card he plays the card and the card he plays becomes the base card. 
The game allows you to play multiple cards per turn until you dont have a card that can be played again. When you dont have a card that can be played simply enter 0.
Then vice-versa for the computer. 
As the game continues the base card changes as the players play different cards.
If the player tries to play a card that doesn’t have any similarities with the base card an error message is displayed and he has to take the random card from the deck. The computer automatically draws its own card if no card in its pouch can be played.

 If nobody exhausts their cards before the cards in the deck are used up then The winner of the game is determined by who has the least amount of cards with them.# henrys_swegg
